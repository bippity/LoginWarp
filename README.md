# LoginWarp

This is a plugin for TShock that warps people to a TShock warp when they login. This could be useful for tutorial zones for new players, a restricted spawn point, or really anything else you can think of.

## Installation & Configuration

See the page on the [TShock forums for more information](https://tshock.co/xf/index.php?resources/loginwarp.44/).
